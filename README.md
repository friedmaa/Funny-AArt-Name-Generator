# Funny-Art-Name-Generator

This program randomly generates names in the style "The [adjective] [noun] of [noun]" the somewhat resemble avant garde art names. The words are randomly chosen from two lists of nouns and adjectives, which are contained in text files. These can be exchanged for any file of choice, but to avoid changing the code directly, said file must be named "adjectives" or "nouns."
